## Abstract
Given the overturn of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, our group is concerned about how millions of people across the United States are affected by abortion restrictions. Post-Roe America is imperative to discuss as it impacts the lives of everyoneâ€“creating further political polarization and risking the health and safety of all within the country. To address this, we plan to present and analyze data demonstrating what the end of this 50-year precedent means for Americans and consequently, the dangers that may arise.
