## Abstract
Given the overturn of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, our group is concerned about how millions of people across the United States are affected by abortion restrictions. Post-Roe America is imperative to discuss as it impacts the lives of everyone–creating further political polarization and risking the health and safety of all within the country. To address this, we plan to present and analyze data demonstrating what the end of this 50-year precedent means for Americans and consequently, the dangers that may arise.

## Introduction
In 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States established that the Due Process Clause in the Constitution protects people’s rights to undergo an abortion under safe medical procedures. Fifty years later, this precedent has been overturned. Now, in a post-Roe America, states have the right to decide their stance on abortions by either protecting the procedure or outright banning it. This poses as an issue since it directly restricts people’s rights to full bodily autonomy, often without exceptions for unwanted pregnancies from rape or incest. 

Although we live in Washington state where abortions are protected with expanded access, our project still aims to spread awareness on the urgency of this issue throughout the United States by presenting data and factual information in one place. 

## Problem Domain
With the issue at hand, we must analyze all the factors that involve restricted abortions in America. Often, in conservative, far-right leaning states, women and others who are able to become pregnant are direct stakeholders when discussing this situation as they are most affected by Roe’s overturn. As of last month, it has been said that, “...West Virginia passed a near total [abortion] ban that will be signed by their governor in [the] coming days,” presenting alarming decisions made in these states that will further restrict everyone’s rights. Indirect stakeholders living in Washington state and other abortion-protected states are not personally being affected by this decision, yet still face the consequences associated with the restrictions as direct stakeholders will often seek the procedure in these protected states instead.

Given the decision to overturn Roe, the rights of American citizens across the country have been thoroughly ignored. The bodily autonomy of these people are put at risk, directly violating the value criterion that defines what people consider important in life. Values of access to safe, legal abortions should therefore not be a political debate and is instead an issue of human rights. Considering these values, many believe that, “Countries have obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, including those concerning sexual and reproductive health and autonomy.” With this in mind, restrictive abortion access is not only a breach of privacy, it’s a breach of human values.

If data and technology were to intervene in this situation, there are multiple effects that could occur. From one perspective, the collected information could help present to lawmakers and government figures that abortion restrictions only create further harm for people and America as a whole. By compiling numerous sources together, this could potentially lead to better resources for direct stakeholders as it pressures the system into reconsidering these restrictive policies. On the other hand however, new technology that is able to track personal data presents a threat to pregnant people seeking abortions in restricted states. An article describes that, “Until this past May, anyone could buy a weekly trove of data on clients at more than 600 Planned Parenthood sites around the country for as little as $160..” The data collected includes addresses, clinic visits, and income brackets, putting these people at risk of being criminalized for violating the state regulations. 

Ultimately, all of these aspects combine together to present issues concerning abortions in America. 

## Research Questions
### 1. What are the effects of the overturn of Roe v. Wade?
The overturn of Roe v. Wade will restrict the rights of millions of women across America. Understanding the impact these restrictions will create, and the challenges that come up from them is essential. For example, according to ABCNews, restricting safe abortions for women will drastically increase birth rates. However, considering the topic of preventing abortions is highly controversial and leads to debate, discussion on the topic is often avoided. Therefore, we must establish common ground that everyone can understand and not necessarily agree upon but at least support. We will address this question by presenting credible data about pregnancy, abortion, and birthrates to encourage a more open discussion on the subject of abortions and an understanding of the impacts of the overturn of Roe v. Wade. 

### 2. Who will be most impacted by the overturn of Roe v. Wade? 
The overturn of Roe v. Wade has impacted the lives of millions of women across America. However, there are disparities regarding the impacts on women of Color. For example, according to American.edu, the mortality from childbirth is significantly higher in Black women. As the overturn of Roe v. Wade increases the number of childbirths, it is crucial to understand who is the most significantly impacted by these decisions and why. We will address this question by finding data on the rate of mortality of Black women caused by childbirth and compare them to the rate of white women. 

### 3. What economic challenges are created for women with the overturn of Roe v. Wade?
Not only is it important to understand the impacts of the overturn of Roe v. Wade on women during childbirth, but also to understand how it can impose on their futures. For example, Move.org says the average cost of childbirth and childcare in the first year is over $17,000. These high expenses can be detrimental to many women who cannot afford the expensive costs of having a child, creating many financial challenges for themself and their child. We will address this question by looking into the data of the cost of both childbirth and childcare and see how it has changed overtime. Additionally, we will also look into how minimum wage has changed over the years and compare them to the cost rate of childbirth and childcare.  


## Dataset
National and State trends showing pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates describe the root effects of the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Through our research questions, we communicate the impact of this reversal. From the data set, birth rates fluctuate slightly, but this new precedent may lead to higher birth rates and lower abortion rates between the different ages. As a result, the data provided may give us insight as to what the base trends of preganancy and abortion are and how this may change over time.

Isaac Maddow-Zimet, Kathryn Kost, and Sean Finn collected the data in 2020 to bring awareness and demonstrate how reproductive lives have changed over time. The data collected was funded by grants from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The people most likely to benefit from the data are women and others who can become pregnant because the data can help bring awareness to subjects regarding reproductive rights and abortions. The data was validated and held secure by their board, which is made up of credible law professionals and individuals who are experienced and have been working with data for 10+ years. They make sure to verify and provide credible data through thorough research. We obtained the data from Data.world and have made sure to carefully credit the source of the data. 

## Expected Implications
Based on our research questions, the data could provide possible implications for stakeholders as it helps raise awareness about the inaccessibility of abortion rights and predict future trends of pregnancy, birth, and abortion. Abortion has always been a controversial issue and although everyone does not necessarily have to agree upon the same idea, specific statistics on the indices of pregnancy, birth, and abortion could encourage more open discussions and help people to better understand various consequences that could arise to women today and the future. Women and others who can become pregnant can use this data to get new information about how people’s reproductive lives have changed over the decades. In addition, journalists who report on abortion can use this data to predict future trends of pregnancy, birth, and abortion to support their articles. By making this data accessible, more people can realize their rights and have access to the resources they need to protect themselves.
