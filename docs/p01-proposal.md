## Abstract
Given the overturn of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, our group is concerned about how millions of people across the United States are affected by abortion restrictions. Post-Roe America is imperative to discuss as it impacts the lives of everyone–creating further political polarization and risking the health and safety of all within the country. To address this, we plan to present and analyze data demonstrating what the end of this 50-year precedent means for Americans and consequently, the dangers that may arise.

## Introduction
In 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States established that the Due Process Clause in the Constitution protects people’s rights to undergo an abortion under safe medical procedures. Fifty years later, this precedent has been overturned. Now, in a post-Roe America, states have the right to decide their stance on abortions by either protecting the procedure or outright banning it. This poses as an issue since it directly restricts people’s rights to full bodily autonomy, often without exceptions for unwanted pregnancies from rape or incest. 

Although we live in Washington state where abortions are protected with expanded access, our project still aims to spread awareness on the urgency of this issue throughout the United States by presenting data and factual information in one place. 

## Problem Domain
With the issue at hand, we must analyze all the factors that involve restricted abortions in America. Often, in conservative, far-right leaning states, women and others who are able to become pregnant are direct stakeholders when discussing this situation as they are most affected by Roe’s overturn. As of last month, it has been said that, “...West Virginia passed a near total [abortion] ban that will be signed by their governor in [the] coming days,” presenting alarming decisions made in these states that will further restrict everyone’s rights. Indirect stakeholders living in Washington state and other abortion-protected states are not personally being affected by this decision, yet still face the consequences associated with the restrictions as direct stakeholders will often seek the procedure in these protected states instead.

Given the decision to overturn Roe, the rights of American citizens across the country have been thoroughly ignored. The bodily autonomy of these people are put at risk, directly violating the value criterion that defines what people consider important in life. Values of access to safe, legal abortions should therefore not be a political debate and is instead an issue of human rights. Considering these values, many believe that, “Countries have obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, including those concerning sexual and reproductive health and autonomy.” With this in mind, restrictive abortion access is not only a breach of privacy, it’s a breach of human values.

If data and technology were to intervene in this situation, there are multiple effects that could occur. From one perspective, the collected information could help present to lawmakers and government figures that abortion restrictions only create further harm for people and America as a whole. By compiling numerous sources together, this could potentially lead to better resources for direct stakeholders as it pressures the system into reconsidering these restrictive policies. On the other hand however, new technology that is able to track personal data presents a threat to pregnant people seeking abortions in restricted states. An article describes that, “Until this past May, anyone could buy a weekly trove of data on clients at more than 600 Planned Parenthood sites around the country for as little as $160..” The data collected includes addresses, clinic visits, and income brackets, putting these people at risk of being criminalized for violating the state regulations. 

Ultimately, all of these aspects combine together to present issues concerning abortions in America. 

## Research Questions
### 1. How birthrates and abortion rate changed after the passing of Roe v. Wade?
The passing of Roe v. Wade allowed for more women to have access to safe abortions. With this given, we wanted to see the impacts Roe v. Wade had for women across America. Specifically looking into birthrates and abortion rates, we can see if the legalization of safe abortions has led to less people being forced into child birth, and instead, making decisions for their own bodies. This research question is important because we can gain insight into the implementation of Roe v. Wade in hopes that it will further prove why Roe v. Wade should not be outlawed. We will approach this research question by looking at the birthrates and abortion rate after 1973 (when Roe v. Wade was passed), and comparing how their rates have changed throughout the years.

### 2. How have abortion rates changed in both the most abortion supporting state and least supporting state after the passing of Roe v. Wade?
The topic of abortion has been a highly debated topic between conservative and liberal states, where conservative states are against and liberal states are for abortions. We wanted to compare how abortion rates changed between two states with opposing opinions on the subject and see how those opinions may impact abortion rates. This question is important because by understanding how different places in America handle and view abortions, we can understand the impact it can have on abortion rates overall. We will approach this question by comparing the total abortion rates throughout the years between two specific states (one mainly against abortions and one mainly for abortions) after the passing of Roe v. Wade. 

### 3. How have pregnancy rates in different age groups been impacted after the passing of Roe v. Wade?
Without access to abortions, many women who are either not ready or do not want to have a child are forced into having one. A lot of the time, many women are not ready because they are too young and are not able to provide and support for a child. By looking into how the passing of Roe v. Wade and how pregnancy rates have changed throughout the years for different age groups, we can understand which group of women are most likely to be impacted and benefit by having access to safer abortions. We will approach this question by comparing the averages of pregnancy rates after the passing of Roe v. Wade between specific age groups. 

## Dataset
National and State trends showing pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates describe the root effects the passing of Roe v. Wade. Through our research questions, we communicate the impact of this reversal. From the data set, birth rates fluctuate slightly, but this new precedent may lead to higher birth rates and lower abortion rates between the different ages. As a result, the data provided may give us insight as to what the base trends of pregnancy and abortion are and how this may change over time.

Isaac Maddow-Zimet, Kathryn Kost, and Sean Finn collected the data in 2020 to bring awareness and demonstrate how reproductive lives have changed over time. The data collected was funded by grants from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The people most likely to benefit from the data are women and others who can become pregnant because the data can help bring awareness to subjects regarding reproductive rights and abortions. The data was validated and held secure by their board, which is made up of credible law professionals and individuals who are experienced and have been working with data for 10+ years. They make sure to verify and provide credible data through thorough research. We obtained the data from Data.world and have made sure to carefully credit the source of the data. 

## Expected Implications
Based on our research questions, the data could provide possible implications for stakeholders as it helps raise awareness about the inaccessibility of abortion rights and predict future trends of pregnancy, birth, and abortion. Abortion has always been a controversial issue and although everyone does not necessarily have to agree upon the same idea, specific statistics on the indices of pregnancy, birth, and abortion could encourage more open discussions and help people to better understand various consequences that could arise to women today and the future. Women and others who can become pregnant can use this data to get new information about how people’s reproductive lives have changed over the decades. In addition, journalists who report on abortion can use this data to predict future trends of pregnancy, birth, and abortion to support their articles. By making this data accessible, more people can realize their rights and have access to the resources they need to protect themselves. 

## Limitations
Some limitations from the data are missing information and lack of data about racial disparities in pregnancy, birth and abortion. First of all, the data only includes statistics that cover the period from 1973 to 2017, which leaves us with no information of statistics from 2018 to 2022. Missing information can limit our progress of discovering trends of people’s reproductive lives as the data only include past statistics and not current statistics. In order to include recent data, we will try to do some additional research about current statistics. Another limitation would be that there are some missing pieces of data in the data set labeled "NA." Having missing data restricts us with less information to work with and makes our findings less accurate than what they could be. The only way we could think of addressing this limitation is keeping in mind when answering our research questions that our data might be slightly inaccurate or not represent the whole picture of what we are trying to find.
