## Abstract
Given the overturn of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, our group is concerned about how millions of people across the United States are affected by abortion restrictions. Post-Roe America is imperative to discuss as it impacts the lives of everyone–creating further political polarization and risking the health and safety of all within the country. To address this, we plan to present and analyze data demonstrating what the end of this 50-year precedent means for Americans and consequently, the dangers that may arise.

## Introduction
In 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States established that the Due Process Clause in the Constitution protects people’s rights to undergo an abortion under safe medical procedures. Fifty years later, this precedent has been overturned. Now, in a post-Roe America, states have the right to decide their stance on abortions by either protecting the procedure or outright banning it. This poses as an issue since it directly restricts people’s rights to full bodily autonomy, often without exceptions for unwanted pregnancies from rape or incest. 

Although we live in Washington state where abortions are protected with expanded access, our project still aims to spread awareness on the urgency of this issue throughout the United States by presenting data and factual information in one place. 

## Problem Domain
With the issue at hand, we must analyze all the factors that involve restricted abortions in America. Often, in conservative, far-right leaning states, women and others who are able to become pregnant are direct stakeholders when discussing this situation as they are most affected by Roe’s overturn. As of last month, it has been said that, “...West Virginia passed a near total [abortion] ban that will be signed by their governor in [the] coming days,” presenting alarming decisions made in these states that will further restrict everyone’s rights. Indirect stakeholders living in Washington state and other abortion-protected states are not personally being affected by this decision, yet still face the consequences associated with the restrictions as direct stakeholders will often seek the procedure in these protected states instead.

Given the decision to overturn Roe, the rights of American citizens across the country have been thoroughly ignored. The bodily autonomy of these people are put at risk, directly violating the value criterion that defines what people consider important in life. Values of access to safe, legal abortions should therefore not be a political debate and is instead an issue of human rights. Considering these values, many believe that, “Countries have obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, including those concerning sexual and reproductive health and autonomy.” With this in mind, restrictive abortion access is not only a breach of privacy, it’s a breach of human values.

If data and technology were to intervene in this situation, there are multiple effects that could occur. From one perspective, the collected information could help present to lawmakers and government figures that abortion restrictions only create further harm for people and America as a whole. By compiling numerous sources together, this could potentially lead to better resources for direct stakeholders as it pressures the system into reconsidering these restrictive policies. On the other hand however, new technology that is able to track personal data presents a threat to pregnant people seeking abortions in restricted states. An article describes that, “Until this past May, anyone could buy a weekly trove of data on clients at more than 600 Planned Parenthood sites around the country for as little as $160..” The data collected includes addresses, clinic visits, and income brackets, putting these people at risk of being criminalized for violating the state regulations. 

Ultimately, all of these aspects combine together to present issues concerning abortions in America.
